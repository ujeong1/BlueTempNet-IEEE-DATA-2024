## Network Files

Our networks are saved in GEXF as follows:

- **graph_dimension1.gexf**: Feed member interaction network saved in DiGraph object, where an edge has attributes `sign` and `time` and a node is Feed member.

- **graph_dimension2.gexf**: Feed creator interaction network saved in DiGraph object, where an edge has attributes `sign` and `time`, and a node is Feed creator.

- **graph_dimension3.gexf**: Community interaction network saved in a Graph object. Each node has a node attribute that can be a member, creator, or feed. Each edge has an edge attribute, either `join` or `create`, along with a `time` attribute.

- **multi_graph.gexf**: This is a MultiGraph object that integrates the three network dimensions. To facilitate ease of use, all undirected edges in the multigraph have been converted to bidirectional edges.
